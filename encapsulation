-> What is encapsulation in python ?

	-> Wrapping up data and methods working on data together in a single unit (i.e class) is called as encapsulation


	-> encapsulation ke madad se apne class ke bahar se koi bhi property or method access nahi kar sakte 


-> Access Modifiers:
	
	-> Generally, we restrict data access outside the class in encapsulation

	-> Three Access Specifiers: public, private, protected

		-> public variables access everywhere in class or outside class

		-> private access within class. or aap object ke madad se class ke bahr bhi acess nahi kar sakte

		-> protected access within class or its subclass but python mai protected jada use nahi hota hai




-> Note: class and function are always callable function in python
