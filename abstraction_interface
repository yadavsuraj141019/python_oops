-> What is Abstraction ?
	
	-> the process by which data and function are defined in such a way that only essential details can be seen and unnecessary implementations are hidden is called data abstraction


	syntax: 

			from abc import ABC,abstractmethod
			class Employee(ABC):

					abstract methods
					concrete methods


	-> in python abstraction is declared as abc module

	-> abstract methods:- method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation of methods


-> What is Abstract Class:

	-> A class which contains one or more abstract methods and concrete methods

	-> Abstract class must have at least one abstract method

	-> we can not create objects of abstract class.....

	-> abstract class requires at least one abstract method...

	-> all abstract methods should present in abstract class must be implemented in child classes, else child class becomes abstract class.....
